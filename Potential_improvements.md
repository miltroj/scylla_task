# Potential Improvements

## Code Improvements
- **Thread pooling**: Implement thread pooling to manage and optimize the use of multiple threads.
- **Config from YAML/JSON**: Allow configuration to be passed not only through CLI arguments but also from a configuration file (YAML or JSON).
- **Improved Exception Handling**: Enhance exception handling to provide more user-friendly messages and handle exceptions in the context of concurrent processes.
- **Cluster Health Check**: Add a mechanism to check the health of the ScyllaDB cluster before starting the stress tests.
- **Typing**: Implement type hinting across the project to improve code readability and maintainability.
- **Docstrings**: Ensure all functions and methods are well-documented with clear docstrings.
- **Structure Changes**: Refactor and reorganize the codebase to follow a more modular structure.
- **More Unit Tests**: Increase test coverage by adding additional unit tests.
- **Results as HTML with Details**: Format stress test results as an HTML report with detailed insights.
- **Progress Bar**: Add a progress bar to track the status of stress tests.
- **Built-in Alerting**: Implement an alerting system that notifies when certain thresholds are reached.

## Docker Improvements
- **SPIKE - Propagating Cassandra Output as JSON**: Investigate and implement an option to propagate Cassandra stress test output as JSON for easier parsing and analysis.

## Parser
- **Match Regexp on IP**: Improve IP address validation by using regular expressions.
- **Output to HTML**: Enhance the parser to output the results in an HTML format.
- **Log Severity**: Add support for different log severity levels (e.g., info, warning, error).

## CI/CD
- **Test Pipelines**: Set up automated testing pipelines for continuous integration.
- **Tox**: Integrate Tox for testing across different environments.
- **Release Notes**: Automate the generation of release notes for new versions.
- **Release to PyPI and Versioning**: Automate versioning and releases to PyPI.
- **Static Tests**: Incorporate static code analysis tools (e.g., flake8, pylint).

## Poetry
- **Entrypoint**: Add an entry point to the project through Poetry to simplify execution.

## Logging
- **Severity**: Implement log severity levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, ERROR) for better logging control.
- **Single Instance**: Use a singleton logger to ensure consistent logging across the application.
- **Logging to File Handler**: Add an option to log output to a file for easier debugging and tracking.

## Installation
- **Makefile**: Add a Makefile to simplify project setup, testing, and execution.
  - **Test**: Create Makefile targets for running tests, pulling Docker images, and setting up the environment.
  - **Pull**: Automate pulling necessary Docker images.
  - **Install**: Automate installing dependencies and setting up the environment.
  - **Get Node IP**: Automate the process of retrieving the ScyllaDB node IP.

## ReadMe
- **Use Sphinx for Documentation**: Generate and host detailed project documentation using Sphinx.
- **Contribution Guide**: Add a guide for contributing to the project, including coding standards and workflow.
- **Contact**: Provide contact information for project maintainers.
- **Badges**: Add CI/CD badges, license badges, etc., to the README for a professional look.
- **Logo**: Create and add a logo for the project.
- **PR Template**: Add a pull request template to standardize contributions.
- **Issue Template**: Add an issue template to streamline the process of reporting bugs or requesting features.
